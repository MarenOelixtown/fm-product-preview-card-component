## Overview

### The challenge

The challenge is to build out this product preview card component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- using BEM naming conventions for CSS structure

### What I learned

With a good structure, the code is easier to understand .

### Continued development

In future projects I will continue focusing on using BEM. And for bigger projects I want to create multiple stylesheets for different parts of the application to structure e.g. global style, by thinking in reusable components.

### Useful resources

- [BEM](https://getbem.com/introduction/) - It suggests the concept of blocks, elements and modifiers for CSS structure.
